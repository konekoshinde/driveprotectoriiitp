        <br/>
        <h3>this is a group project based on cryptography in cloud</h3>
        <p>as we are unaware that data is stored in unencrypted form on drive thus there is a need to protect
            it from getting stolen
            <br/>
            thus we come up with solution of drive protector. With our specialised algorthims and use of encryption methods
            we maintain the confidentialiyt,integrity and also authority of drive storage
        </p>
